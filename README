Hello Team,

This project was a lot of fun. I've always wanted to learn more about kafka and this gave me the opportunity to do just that.

I have commented up the code quite a bit with TODOs and design assumptions.

I built this jar using Maven on IntelliJ IDE.

How to run:
Here is the command I am running to kick off the jar.

"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15\bin\java.exe" "-javaagent:C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2020.2.2\lib\idea_rt.jar=62892:C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2020.2.2\bin" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath C:\Users\xferg\IdeaProjects\MongoDBChallenge\target\classes MongoDBChallenge

and the jar can be found in the target folder named MongoDBChallenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

If you have any questions, please feel free to shoot me an email. Ian.Roger.Ferguson@gmail.com
